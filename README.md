# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Visual representation of popular sorting algorithms in ascending order.

#### What is this about?
This project is a basic simulation of a multiple sorting algorithm.
The user can choose what sorting algorithm they want visualized and run it.
The user can also shuffle the list as needed.

### What did I use?
- Python's pygame for graphics
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort

### Controls
- `ENTER` to start simulation
- `LEFT ARROW` for last algorithm
- `RIGHT ARROW` for next algorithm
- `R` to shuffle List
